<p>
At Mass Bay I was fortunate to be the President of the Phi Theta Kappa: Alpha Kappa Lambda Chapter<br> and President of the Biotechnology Innovations Club<br></p>
<p>
My career goals are to help with data research to help in therapies and possible cures for connective tissue disorders.<br> As a person with EDS myself I want to help in whatever way I can.<br></p>
<p>
Prior to returning to school in addition to horticulture I worked as a touring musician, artist, poet, and ran a music,<br> arts, and literature magazine. &hearts; <br></p>
